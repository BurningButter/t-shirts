# T-shirt randomiser
A small website for Hack Club "[High-Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/)" that randomly grabs cat pictures and makes quotes to put on a t-shirt.

## Demo
The website is live here:

## Features


## Inspiration
I wanted to make *something* for this event and all my other projects were way too ambious so I settled for a random prompt from the website.
