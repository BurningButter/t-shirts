T-shirt Generator
===============

A small website for Hack Club "[High-Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com/)" that randomly grabs cat pictures and makes quotes to put on a t-shirt.

Demo
---------------

The website is live here:
https://hackclub.burningbutter.com/t-shirt

Features
---------------

+ Images from [TheCatAPI.com](https://thecatapi.com/)
+ 9200+ possible quotes with my high-tech system of "nested algorithmic stochastic conditionals"
+ A base t-shirt image of unknown origin

Inspiration
---------------

I wanted to make *something* for this event and all my other projects were way too ambious so I settled for a random prompt from [the website](https://highseas.hackclub.com/), just so I could have something shipped before the event ends.
